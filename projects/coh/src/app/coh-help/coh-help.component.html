<h2 class="mt-4" id="chart-view">Chart View</h2>
<p> The Data Portal has three basic view modes: Chart View, Table View and Series View. By default, the Data Portal loads the "At A Glance" summary in Chart View displaying charts of a selection of indicators from all categories available.</p>  

<img src="assets/ChartView1.png" alt="Screenshot of Chart View" id="chart-view-screenshot">
<p class="mt-3">
  In the menu on the left side of the screen you can select from different categories of data to display.
  For example, selecting <strong class="emphasis-blue">Economic Indicators</strong> will load a summary of the portal's Economic Indicators and make all of the subcategories of economic indicators visible.
</p>
<img src="assets/ChartView2.png" id="chart-view-screenshot2" alt="Screenshot of Economic Indicators Summary Chart View with drop down selectors circled and date slider circled?">
<p class="mt-3">In any view mode, at the top of the page are selectors for the <strong class="emphasis-red">region and frequency</strong>. In the screen shot above, the region is set to "Hawaii County" and the frequency to "Annual". Using the region pull-down 
  you can select between "Hawaii County" and the "State of Hawaii", and the frequency selector offers "Annual", "Quarterly" or "Monthly" choices. Next to the frequency selector is a toggle to switch to Table View (more on that below). The sample period displayed can be adjusted using the starting and ending period <strong class="emphasis-blue">sliders</strong>, or you can click in the <strong class="emphasis-green">date boxes</strong> on either side of the sliders to type your desired starting or ending period.  
  <em>Note that changing the frequency or region may result in a different subset of series being displayed in 
  chart view, as not all data are available at all frequencies and for all regions.</em>
</p>
<p>
  In the upper left corner of each chart you will find the name of the indicator displayed, the date of the last value in the chart (with units in parentheses), and the year-over-year percent change (or absolute change where appropriate). For example, in the screen shot above, the first chart plots <strong>Total Nonfarm Jobs</strong>, the last available annual data point is from 2018 with a value 69.4 and the series is measured in thousands (Thous), so there were 69,400 non farm jobs in Hawaii County in 2018. Hovering your mouse cursor over a series will display values at different points in time. In the bottom left corner of each chart is a <strong class="emphasis-orange">star</strong>. When selected, the star outline is filled solid and the indicator is added to the <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="analyzer" (click)="onContentsLinkClick()"><strong class="emphasis-green">Analyzer</strong></a> used for grouping and comparing multiple indicators. The Analyzer is described in detail below.
</p>
<p>From Chart View, you can toggle to a Table View of the currently displayed indicators using the icon to the right of the frequency selector.</p>
<h2 class="mt-4" id="table-view">Table View</h2>
<img src="assets/TableView2.png" alt="Screenshot of Table View" id="table-view-screenshot">
<p class="mt-3">
  In Table View, in addition to the selectors described above, there are toggles for  switching back to chart view, to display year-over-year percent change (absolute change where appropriate), and year-to-date growth rate for indicators at the monthly or quarterly frequency. You can change your sample size using the same controls available in Chart View. If the sample selected is too large to fit on the screen, you can scroll the table horizontally to display the remaining observations. (<em>Note that in some browsers the horizontal scroll bar is hidden until you actually begin scrolling.</em>) The <strong class="emphasis-blue">Analyzer Download CSV</strong> link saves a Comma Separated Values formatted file of the table to your downloads folder. A CSV file easily loads in Excel or other software programs. Any indicator in the table can be added to the <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="analyzer" (click)="onContentsLinkClick()">Analyzer</a> by selecting the <strong class="emphasis-orange">Analyzer star</strong>, located to the right of the name of each indicator.  Selecting the information icon next to the star pops up a box with more information about the selected indidator including a description and source links.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-4" id="series-view">Series View</h2>
<img src="assets/seriesview2.png" alt="Screenshot of Series View" id="series-view-screenshot">
<p class="mt-3">
  To view a chart of a single indicator in Series View click on the indicator name, or any of the individual charts while in <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="chart-view" (click)="onContentsLinkClick()">Chart View</a>. The Series View plots a single indicator using a line measured on the right axis and the year-over-year percent change (or absolute change) displayed as bars measured on the left axis.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Header controls:</strong> At the top of the chart, in addition to the familiar selector boxes, you can also toggle whether the chart displays seasonally-adjusted indicators or the non-seasonally-adjusted indicator if both are available. The link button next to the frequency selector copies a static URL for the current chart. This URL can be bookmarked, shared or otherwise used to reproduce the chart as it appears on the screen. As in each of the other views, to add an indicator to the <a [routerLink]="['.']" fragment="analyzer" (click)="onContentsLinkClick()">Analyzer</a>, toggle the <b><strong class="emphasis-orange">star</strong></b>, located at the top of the chart following the indicator name.
<p>
  <strong>Sample selection:</strong> There are multiple controls for setting the range of the data viewed. There are the familiar date boxes in the upper right corner of the chart. In the top-left corner of the chart are links to zoom the displayed sample to the last year, the last five years, the last ten years, or all available data. The spark line below the main chart displays the entire range of data and has <strong class="emphasis-red">sliders</strong> to select any part of the full sample.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Export:</strong> In the top-right corner of the chart area, click <strong class="emphasis-orange">Download</strong> to choose from
  PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF or CSV exports of the selected data.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Information and data view:</strong> Below the chart is the source of the data, a link to the source agency, and any relevant notes followed by a row of summary statistics measured over the currently selected range and a table displaying the data with the option of <strong class="emphasis-orange">sorting</strong> by date either ascending or descending.
</p>
  
<h2 class="mt-4" id="analyzer">Using the Analyzer Tool</h2>
<img src="assets/Analyzer.png" alt="Screenshot of Analyzer" id="analyzer-screenshot">
<p class="mt-3">
  In the previous two screen shots, we added Hawaii County Non-farm jobs and the Honolulu Core CPI Inflation rate to the Analyzer. Click on <strong>Analyzer(2)</strong> at the bottom of the left-hand menu. The number in the parentheses indicates the number of series you have starred.
</p>
<p>
  The Analyzer plots the starred series together in one graph and autmatically choses whether to use a two-scale or single-scale graph depending on the units of the indicators. For example, in the screen shot above, the inflation rate is plotted on the right axis in percent, and non-farm jobs are plotted on the left axis measured in thousands of jobs. If you have added (starred) more than two indicators, Analyzer plots only the first two indicators and lists all of the starred indicators in the table immediately below the chart in the order they were starred.
</p>
<p id="analyzer-controls">
  <strong>Analyzer Chart Controls:</strong> The analyzer chart has all of the same controls discussed above for Series View, with the exception of region, frequency, and seasonal adjustment selectors. Those are not available because they are determined for each indicator when added to the Analyzer. New chart controls include three selectors at the bottom to toggle tool tips for <strong class="emphasis-blue">Series Name, Units, and Geography</strong>. The screen shot above shows the mouse hover over at 2005Q2 with the Units and Geography tool tips toggled on.
</p> 
<p>
  Additional control over the indicators displayed in the chart is available using the gear icons next to each indicator name in the data table directly below the chart. As long as you have added at least two indicators to the Analyzer, clicking the gear icon gives you the options to <em>Removing from Analyzer</em> (the trashcan), <em>Swap Y-axes</em>, or <em>Remove from Chart</em> as shown in the screen shot below. If you have more than two indicators in your Analyzer list, the gear icon for indicators not currently displayed will offer an <em>Add to Chart</em> check box.
</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Analyzer 2" src="assets/Analyzer2.png" id="analyzer-screenshot2">
<p class="mt-3">
  <strong>Switching Axis:</strong> If all of your selected series use the same units and similar scale, the Switch Y-Axis option will toggle between displaying the data with a single y-axis, versus two separate y-axes (left and right). Otherwise, the option swaps the axis on which the indicators are measured. The legend below the chart indicates which axis each series is plotted on. You may choose to display as many series as you wish, but of course there are only two y-axes, so it is possible to create graphs that are not very useful for series with very different orders of magnitude.
</p>
<p id="exporting">
  <strong>Export and Saving:</strong> For any Analyzer screen, you can select the <strong class="emphasis-blue">link</strong> above the chart next to the Analyzer title to copy a static URL that can be bookmarked, shared, and otherwise used to link back to the current view and settings of the Analyzer. As in the Series View described above, the <strong class="emphasis-orange">Download</strong> link in the top right corner of the chart will present an option to download the Analyzer chart as a PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF or CSV file.
</p>
<p id="analyzer-data-table">
  <strong>Data Table</strong>: The data table below the Analyzer chart has the same features as the tables in Table View.
</p>
<img alt="Screenshot of Analyzer Tables" src="assets/AnalyzerTables.png" id="analyzer-tables">
<p>
  <strong>Summary Stats</strong>: Below the data table is a group of summary statistics for each indicator over the date range selected. Statistics inclued the <strong class="emphasis-blue">minimum and maximum</strong> values over the sample,  and by scrolling to the right, the percentage or absolute change in the indicator from start to end of the sample, and the total (sum), average value, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate">Compound Annual Growth Rate</a> (CAGR) over the selected sample.
