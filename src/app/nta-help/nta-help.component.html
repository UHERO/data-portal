<h2>About</h2>
<ol>
<li>Baseline country estimates are deflated (inflated) to 2010 local currency units, and converted to 2010 PPP dollars using
    deflators and exchange rates from the World Bank Development Indicators.</li>
<li>Country group estimates refer to the aggregate of estimates for 181 countries in our NTA sample only. Counts and monetary
    values are summed over countries within country groups, which are then used to calculate country group estimates of indicator
    ratios, and growth rates.</li>
<li>Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia are combined to form the Pacific Islands sub-region due to insufficient number of observations
    within the original sub-regions.</li>
<li>Assumptions: Discount rate =0.030, Productivity growth rate = 0.015; Population projections are based on UN WPP 2017 medium
    variant projection.</li>
