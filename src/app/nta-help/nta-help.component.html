    <p>These NTA indicators quantify the direct effect of changes in population size and age structure on selected macroeconomic
        measures. The indicators are constructed combining population projections with age profiles of consumption and labor
        income for 181 countries. The age profiles of economic variables are held constant over the simulation and, hence,
        all changes are due to shifts in the number of people at each age.
    </p>
    <p>
        The consumption and labor income profiles are constructed following the methods described in Lee and Mason (2011) and UN
        (2013). Labor income by age includes earnings and an estimate of the value of work by the self-employed and unpaid
        family workers. It incorporates age variation in labor force participation, hours worked, unemployment, and wages.
        Consumption includes all public and private consumption allocated to individuals and the age groups to which they
        belong. Estimates of the NTA age profiles are currently available for approximately 60 countries. The age profiles
        for other countries were constructed using methods described in Mason, Lee, et al (2017).
    </p>
    <p>All age profiles have been estimated for a recent year in the local currency of the country in question. Values were
        deflated (inflated) to 2010 and then converted to 2010 PPP dollars using deflators and exchange rates from the World
        Bank Development Indicators.
    </p>
    <p>Values for regional groups and income groups were constructed from the 181 country sample. Counts and monetary values
        are summed over the countries within each group. These are then used to calculate country group estimates of indicator
        ratios and growth rates.
    </p>
    <p>Population estimates and projections by single year of age from 1950 to 2100 are taken from the United Nations World
        Population Prospects 2017, medium variant.
    </p>
    <p>Changes and percentage changes in the indicators are all centered five-year moving averages.</p>

    <h3>Population Count Variables</h3>
    <p>Effective consumers: Sum of population of each age weighted by the per capita age profile of consumption normalized on
        the average consumption of persons 30-49 years of age.
    </p>
    <p>Effective workers: Sum of population of each age weighted by the per capita age profile of labor income normalized on
        the average labor income of persons 30-49 years of age.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Age Structure Variables</h3>
    <p>Support ratio: Effective workers as a percentage of Effective consumers; calculated using labor income and consumption
        profiles normalized on the mean, over ages 30-49, of labor income and consumption respectively.
    </p>
    <p>Support ratio (alternative): Labor income as a percentage of consumption; calculated using labor income and consumption
        profiles normalized on the mean, over ages 30-49, of labor income.
    </p>
    <p>Consumer-worker ratios: Effective number of consumers in broad age groups as a percentage of effective number of workers
        of all ages.
    </p>
    <p>Mean ages of consumption, labor income: Central ages of aggregate consumption and aggregate labor income.</p>
    <p>Longitudinal support ratios: Present value of prospective lifetime effective years of working as a percent of the present
        of prospective lifetime effective years of consuming.
    </p>
    <p>Deficit ratios: Gap between consumption and labor income as a percentage of total labor income.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Economic Aggregates and Per Capita Variables</h3>
    <p>Consumption is computed as the product of the per capita consumption at each age and the estimated or projected population
        of that age. The base year for the age profile is 2010 and it is assumed to shift by 1.5 percent per year.
    </p>
    <p>Labor income is computed as the product of the per capita labor income at each age and the estimated or projected population
        of that age. The base year for the age profile is 2010 and it is assumed to shift by 1.5 percent per year.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>Wealth Variables</h3>
    <p>Present value of consumption at age x in year t is calculated as the present value of consumption to members of the population
        cohort of age x in year t over the remainder of the cohorts existence. A discount rate of 3 percent (real) is used
        to calculate the present value.
    </p>
    <p>Present value of labor income at age x in year t is calculated as the present value of labor income to members of the
        population cohort of age x in year t over the remainder of the cohorts existence. A discount rate of 3 percent (real)
        is used to calculate the present value.
    </p>
    <p>Lifecycle wealth at age x in year t is calculated as the present value of consumption at age x in year t less the present
        value of labor income at age x in year t.
    </p>
    <p>Pre-retirement phase and older includes the final two phases of the lifecycle (pre-retirement and retirement). The lifecycle
        wealth of these age groups is approximately equal to the lifecycle wealth required to fund the old-age deficit, i.e.,
        the gap between consumption and labor income at older ages.
    </p>
    <p>Pension wealth is the lifecycle wealth of all persons in the pre-retirement and retirement phases of the lifecycle.
